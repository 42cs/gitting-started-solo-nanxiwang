# Notes from Fall 14 Workshop

    These notes are currently copied from the meeting minutes
    
* Splitting beginner and advance. Advance was good 
* Rleasing instructions beforehand might not be such a good idea. Might be a natural part about how things to work. 
* DEVELOPEMENT 
* People who knew basic git would have been bored (splitting was good). 
* Prevent advance people from showing up
